cv: Baldassare Galuppi was an Italian composer of the late Baroque and early Classical eras, known for his significant contributions to opera and keyboard music. Born in Burano, a small island near Venice, Galuppi displayed prodigious musical talent from a young age. Galuppi's career flourished in Venice, where he composed numerous operas that were celebrated for their lyrical melodies and innovative orchestration. His operatic works, including *Il filosofo di campagna* and *Il mondo alla rovescia,* enjoyed immense popularity in the 18th century. In addition to opera, Galuppi was a prolific composer of keyboard music, particularly harpsichord sonatas, which showcased his mastery of the keyboard. His compositions often reflected the transition from the ornate Baroque style to the more balanced and structured Classical style. Galuppi's influence extended beyond Italy, as his works were performed throughout Europe, leaving a lasting impact on the development of Classical music. His legacy endures as a key figure in the evolution of operatic and keyboard composition during the 18th century.
