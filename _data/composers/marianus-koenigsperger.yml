cv: Marianus Königsperger entered the Benedictine Abbey of Prüfening as a choir boy and received his scientific and practical music training here. His musical talent proved to be so great that he dropped his theology studies in favor of music. After joining the Benedictine Order (religious vows in 1734), he became organist and choir director in this abbey in the same year and remained a Benedictine brother throughout his life. A thorough training in organ playing and his first works for church and school theater led him to the Lotter publishing house in Augsburg from 1733, and increasingly from 1748 onwards. The extensive volumes of music published by Königsperger led to the composer's considerable earnings, which were then used to promote science and benefited music in the monastery.
