cv: Kobrich worked as organist at the parish church of Mariae Himmelfahrt in Landsberg, a position he held for over 60 years. After his wife's death in 1782, he decided to study theology and was ordained a priest at the age of 68; nevertheless, he retained the office of organist. His extensive collections of church, orchestral and organ music were published mainly by the Augsburg publishing house Lotter and were widely distributed in Central and Eastern Europe.
