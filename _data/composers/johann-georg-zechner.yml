cv: Johann Georg Zechner probably received his musical training in Vienna. 1736–43 he was organist at Göttweig Abbey. He also probably studied philosophy at the University of Vienna. 1744–53 Zechner worked at the Krems parish church of St. Veit as a choir director and composer. After his ordination, he was able to devote himself to his work from 1753 thanks to a benefice at the All Saints Chapel in Stein. Zechner composed Jesuit dramas for Krems as well as festival music for the Göttweig and Melk monasteries and led the church music for the Zentenar festival of the Maria Taferl pilgrimage church in 1760. His works were important for the emergence of the classical style and were widely distributed.
