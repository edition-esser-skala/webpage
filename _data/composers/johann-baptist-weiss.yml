cv: Johann Baptist Weiß visited the Präparandie in Linz. He was probably also a graduate of F. X. Glöggl's private music school. From 1831 to 1843, Weiß was a school assistant under his father in Hörsching, where he soon gained a reputation for being a good organist and composer. On 1 June 1833, he became the sponsor of his cousin Anton Bruckner, whom he taught to play the organ and continuo bass from the late summer of 1835 to the fall of 1836. From 1843 until his suicide, Weiß was a school teacher in Hörsching. His compositional work was of great importance for the young Bruckner.
