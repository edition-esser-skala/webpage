  Johann Michael Haydn was a talented composer and younger brother of the renowned composer Franz Joseph Haydn. He received his early musical education as a choirboy in Vienna, where he honed his skills as a singer and violinist. In 1762, he joined the court of Archbishop Sigismund von Schrattenbach in Salzburg, serving as Konzertmeister and composer. During his tenure, Haydn composed numerous sacred works, including masses, hymns, and oratorios, earning him recognition and respect. Unlike his brother, Haydn's music leaned more towards a conservative and contrapuntal style, influenced by Baroque traditions. His compositions were characterized by meticulous craftsmanship, rich harmonies, and elegant melodies. He left behind a legacy of sacred music and chamber works that continue to be appreciated for their craftsmanship and beauty. Thereby, he made a notable contribution to the musical landscape of his time.
