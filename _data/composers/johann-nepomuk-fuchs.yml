cv: Johann Nepomuk Fuchs studied with Joseph Haydn. From 1784 he worked in Prince Esterh√°zy's chapel and took over its direction after Haydn's death. He retained this post under Prince Nicholas III. and Paul III. Anton for about 40 years. If you believe the few biographical notes available, he was one of the most important church composers of his time. Nevertheless, his works have been almost completely forgotten.
