# Website of the Edition Esser-Skala

This site bases upon the [Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Testing snippets

```python
for counter, repo in [(39, repos[39])]:  # Albrechtsberger, Missa BMV
if counter > 1: break  # for testing
work_dirs = ["453", "46", "145", "142"]  # for testing
if counter not in [45, 76, 84, 116, 156, 205, 229]: # Eybler's works
    continue

with open("all_works.pickle", "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(all_works, f)
with open("all_works.pickle", "rb") as f:
    all_works = pickle.load(f)
```
