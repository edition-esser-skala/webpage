We proudly present the *new website* of the Edition Esser-Skala, which reflects our new corporate design, including a novel logo. The website collects all current and previous versions of our editions and allows to download full scores and parts.

In order to provide high and consistent quality scores, we have revised all editions, which now follow a set of [editorial guidelines](/about/editorial-guidelines) (initial version 2022.01.0).

Moreover, we have implemented a largely automated engraving and publishing [process](/about/technical-documentation) based on LilyPond, LaTeX, Docker, and GitHub Actions. This workflow is freely available as [EES Tools](https://github.com/edition-esser-skala/ees-tools) (initial version 2022.01.0).
