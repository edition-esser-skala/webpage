excerpt: Recommendations for Michael Haydn's short liturgical works
---

The Proprium Missæ project will eventually provide editions of all short liturgical works by Michael Haydn. Now that the first phase of this project comes to a close, it is time to recommend some fascinating works.


## Graduals

The gradual that has fascinated me most is *Exultabunt sancti* ([370](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-370)), a vivid account of Haydn's  creativity. Written in E minor (3/8 time signature), it is a highly dramatic piece that culminates in a surprisingly chromatic Alleluia.

The following works are also of extraordinary interest:

- [341](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-341): Viderunt omnes (polyphonic)
- [342](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-342): Laudate pueri (for female chorus)
- [344](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-344): Hic est discipulus ille
- [345](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-345): Ecce sacerdos magnus
- [351](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-351): Salvos fac nos
- [360](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-360): Dolorosa et lacrymabilis es (extremely sad and colorful)
- [365](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-365): Alleluia, ascendit Deus
- [381](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-381): Benedicite Dominum
- [385](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-385): Timete Dominum (finishes with an allebreve fugue)
- [442](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-442): Universi qui te expectant
- [453](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-453): Tribulationes cordis mei
- [497](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-497): Timebunt gentes (6/8 time signature)
- [638](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-638): Gaude virgo mater Christi
- [827](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-827): Domine Deus salutis meæ (a 4 voci in canone)


## Offertoria

- [183](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-183): Tres sunt, qui testimonium dant (established Haydn's fame as church composer)
- [259](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-259): Quicunque manducaverit (highly dramatic and chromatic solo and tutti parts, very baroque)
- [269](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-269): Canta Ierusalem (rondo)


## Antiphons

- [270](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-270): Alma Redemptoris mater
- [283](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-283): Salve Regina


## Sequences

- [400](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-400): Læta quies magni ducis

(But really, all of them are interesting!).


## Hymns

- [800](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-800): Te Deum


## Misc

- [592/811](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-592-811): Bußgeſang in der Faſtenszeit
- [628](/projects/proprium-missae/#work-mh-628): Introitus, Graduale, Offertorium et Communio ad Missam in Cœna Domini
