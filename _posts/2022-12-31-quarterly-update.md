- [Opus patheticum de septem doloribus Beatæ Virginis Mariæ](/scores/frantisek-xaver-brixi/#work-cz-pu-59-r-25) (CZ-Pu 59 R 25)<br/>
  Brixi was a popular Czech composer in the mid-18th century, who wrote a comprehensive body of sacral music. Although the tradition of his works is somewhat complex, the Opus patheticum is a certain attribution that is available from several libraries and archives. It features a highly chromatic alla breve fugue. Movements 5 and 3 have also been published as gradual and offertorium.

## Technical

We have released a new version of EES Tools ([v2022.12.0](https://github.com/edition-esser-skala/ees-tools/releases/tag/v2022.12.0)), which is based on LilyPond 2.24.0. The version contains several small improvements which are documented in the [changelog](https://github.com/edition-esser-skala/ees-tools/blob/v2022.12.0/CHANGELOG.md). Notably, LilyPond 2.24.0 greatly improves [rendering of bass figures](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.24/Documentation/changes/index.html#chord-notation-improvements), from which our editions indeed will benefit.

We have also switched from Atom (whose development has been abandoned as of 2022-12-15) to [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) as development environment for our scores. The README of EES Tools describes [our setup](https://github.com/edition-esser-skala/ees-tools#-using-a-manual-installation) in more detail. Syntax highlighting is done via a custom [language extension](https://github.com/skafdasschaf/vscode-lilypond-language).
