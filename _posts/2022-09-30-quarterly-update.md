## New editions

### Brixi, František Xaver

- [Missa in E minor](/scores/frantisek-xaver-brixi/#work-novb-ia-17) NovB Ia:17<br/>
  Brixi was a popular Czech composer in the mid-18th century, who wrote a comprehensive body of sacral music. Although the tradition of his works is somewhat complex, the Missa in E minor is a certain attribution that is available from several libraries and archives. The mass comprises both homophonic tutti sections and virtuous arias. Notably, the second Kyrie is a highly chromatic fugue.


### Caldara, Antonio

We conclude our *Caldara@Dresden* project with editions of other sacral music extant in Dresden:

- [Beatus vir](/scores/antonio-caldara/#work-d-dl-mus-2170-e-2) (D-Dl Mus.2170-E-2)

- [Missa Sancti Michaelis](/scores/joseph-leopold-edler-von-eybler/#work-herey-2) HerEy 2


### Galuppi, Baldassare

Galuppi was among the first composers whom we published. In this quarter, we have released another three of his works extant in Dresden:

- the hymn [Jesu corona virginum](/scores/baldassare-galuppi/#work-burg-iv-5) BurG IV/5
- the motet [Sum offensa, sum irata](/scores/baldassare-galuppi/#work-burg-iii-8) BurG III/8
- the hymn [Tantum ergo](/scores/baldassare-galuppi/#work-burg-iv-7) BurG IV/7


### Haydn, Johann Michael

- [Cadenze e Versetti](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-176) MH 176<br/>
A collection of short cadences and versets for organ, set in the eight psalm tones. For each tone, an initial cadence is followed by four versets and a concluding cadence. Although most sections are only a few measures long, they bear witness to Haydn’s extraordinary talent for counterpoint.
- [Litaniæ lauretanæ](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-74) MH 74<br/>
  We previously published the Litaniæ lauretanæ [MH 88](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-88), which is an extended version of MH 74 featuring a mixed chorus (SATB), two trumpets, and timpani. Now, the older version of this litany is also available, whose scoring comprises a female chorus (SSSA) and a church trio.
- The [Proprium Missæ](/projects/haydn-m-proprium-missae/) project now also includes MH 28–34, 93, 162, 180, 192, 345, 368, 381, 383, 391, 398, 410, 429f, 492, 497, 504, 525, 574–576, 627f, 651, 653, 656, 670, 688, 694–696, and 836.
