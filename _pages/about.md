What started as a side project for generating scores for the Cantorey has grown into a full-fledges publishing project with its own

[Editorial guidelines](editorial-guidelines).

Moreover, we strive for an up-to-date technical implementation, which comprises
- beautiful music engraving using LilyPond
- beautifuk prefatory material with LaTeX
- fully-automated score generation using GitHub Actions and the ees-tools DOcker container.

See [here](technical-documentation) for the complete technical documentation.

<!-- Highlights include

- the late works of Jan Dismas Zelenka (in particular, his unprecedented *Missae ultimae*)
- a selection of the works by Baldassare Galuppi kept in Dresden
