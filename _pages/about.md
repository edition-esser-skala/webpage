The Edition Esser-Skala provides practitioners with reliable, open-source modern editions of (mainly) 18th century sacral music. Our highlights include

- various unpublished works by Johann [Michael Haydn](/scores/johann-michael-haydn), many of which are collected in the [Proprium Missæ](/projects/proprium-missae/) project
- passions and oratorios by Johann Heinrich [Rolle](/scores/johann-heinrich-rolle) as well as Gottfried Heinrich [Stölzel](/scores/gottfried-heinrich-stoelzel)
- a bilingual (Danish/German) edition of Friedrich Ludwig Æmilius [Kunzen](/scores/friedrich-ludwig-aemilius-kunzen)'s *Skabningens Halleluja* (*Das Halleluja der Schöpfung*)
- a selection of the works by Baldassare [Galuppi](/scores/baldassare-galuppi) kept in Dresden
- Austrian “superstars” such as Joseph Leopold [Eybler](/scores/joseph-leopold-edler-von-eybler), Florian Leopold [Gassmann](/scores/florian-leopold-gassmann), Leopold [Hofmann](/scores/leopold-hofmann), and František Ignác Antonín [Tůma](/scores/frantisek-ignac-antonin-tuma)

To compile these editions, we utilize freely available manuscripts and prints, which are provided by an increasing number of [archives and libraries](sources-for-digital-versions).

Our editions follow a set of [editorial guidelines](editorial-guidelines) to ensure high quality. Moreover, we have implemented a largely automated engraving and publishing process. Briefly, this workflow encompasses
- beautiful scores engraved by [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org),
- prefatory material typeset with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and
- compilation of editions via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container to ensure reproducibility.

Details on the workflow are available in the comprehensive [technical documentation](technical-documentation).
